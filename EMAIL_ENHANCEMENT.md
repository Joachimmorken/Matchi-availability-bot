## 🚀 Usage

### Same Commands, Better Experience
All existing commands work exactly the same - just with enhanced emails:

```bash
# Test the new email system
python check_availability.py test-email

# Start monitoring (emails automatically enhanced)
python check_availability.py monitor

# Test notifications
python check_availability.py test-notifications
```

### Environment Configuration
Same environment variables as before:

```bash
EMAIL_ENABLED=1
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SSL=0
SMTP_USER=your@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your_app_password
EMAIL_FROM=your@gmail.com
EMAIL_TO=recipient@example.com
```

## 🎯 Key Features Maintained

### Original Logic Preserved
- **Only New Courts**: Emails are still sent ONLY when new courts become available
- **Same Filtering**: Time range filtering (`--between`) works the same
- **Same Scheduling**: Monitoring intervals and date ranges unchanged
- **Same Facilities**: Voldsløkka and Frogner monitoring unchanged

### Backward Compatibility
- **Fallback System**: If enhanced emails fail, falls back to original plain text
- **No Dependencies Required**: System works even without Jinja2 installed
- **Same API**: All function signatures maintained for existing code

## 📱 Email Previews

The system now generates HTML previews for testing:
- `test_new_courts_email.html` - Preview of new courts notification
- `test_email_preview.html` - Preview of test email

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Enhanced Emails Don't Work
The system automatically falls back to plain text emails if:
- Jinja2 is not installed
- Template files are missing
- Template rendering fails

### Installation
If you want the full enhanced experience:
```bash
pip install jinja2
```

Run the demo script to test template rendering:
```bash
